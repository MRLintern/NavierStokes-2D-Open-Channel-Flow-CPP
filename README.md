# NavierStokes-2D-Open-Channel-Flow-CPP

## Introduction
* This is a __Modern C++__ version of the [NavierStokes-2D-Open-Channel-Flow Fortran Solver](https://github.com/MRLintern/NavierStokes-2D-Open-Channel-Flow). 
* The __2D Navier-Stokes Equations__ are discretisised via the __Finite Difference Method__. 
* The __Velocity__ and __Pressure__ matrices are solved via the __Successice Over Relaxation (SOR)__ Iterative Method. 
* The resulting data (`.dat/.csv`) will be plotted via a `Python script`. I will also attempt to make an `animation` of the __Velocity__ and __Pressure__ fields.

## Requirements
* Compiler: `g++ 13.3.1`.
* Developed on `Linux (Ubuntu 20.04)`.
* Developed with `Sublime Text`.
* `CMake`.
* `Python 3.7.6` for running the `visualisation script`.
